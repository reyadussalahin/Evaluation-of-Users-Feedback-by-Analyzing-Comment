It's a risky work. We often toil away in unsafe buildings where the exits
and windows are often blocked.
#
Despite of progress, children are still involved in the production of textiles,
where the working environment is unsafe for them.
#
Conditions are very poor to survive. Demanding higher wages can prove deadly.
One labor leader who did just that was found murdered last year.
#
It's difficult to access the factories for safety purpose. It took
firefighters all night to put out a fire in a factory last year that
killed more than 100 people, reportedly because the access road to
the factory was difficult to traverse.
#
We are trapped inside our factory for hours. We often are locked
inside the building for our entire shift, sometimes longer if we
work overtime.
#
Women work mainly as helpers, machinists and less frequently, as
line supervisors and quality controllers. There are no female
cutting masters. Men dominate the administrative and
management level jobs. Women are discriminated against in
terms of access to higher-paid white collar and management
positions.
#
Taking the advantages of workers' poverty and ignorance the
owners forced them to work in unsafe and unhealthy work place
overcrowded with workers beyond capacity of the factory floor
and improper ventilation. It leads to a destruction that causes
death to theworkers. They also violate the safety code in order to
gain the huge profit in view of owners.
#
The current pay scale given by the government is relatively very
low in comparison to living standard. But the environment is quite
friendly as managers want to know our demands frequently.

কারখানা শ্রমিকের কাজ বেশ ঝুঁকিপূর্ণ। আমাদেরকে ধুলোবালি, ধোঁয়া, আগুন, গ্যাস, উচ্চ শব্দ ও
বিপজ্জনক সরঞ্জামের সাথে অনেক উচ্চতায় অথবা ভূগর্ভেও কাজ করতে হয়।
#
যাতায়াতের পথ কারখানার কাঁচামাল ও যন্ত্রপাতি দিয়ে বন্ধ। জরুরি প্রয়োজনে নিরাপদ স্থানে যাওয়ার
জন্য বের হওয়ার পথের অভাব রয়েছে। যে কয়েকটা সিঁড়ি আছে, তাও ঠিকমত
রক্ষণাবেক্ষণ করা হয় না।
